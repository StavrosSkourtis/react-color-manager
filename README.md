Color Management Tool
=====

This is a very simle tool that lets you add/edit/remove colors to list.
It allows the user to pick a color using decimal or hex RGB value and view it live before selecting it. It is made using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).


## Running the example.

Execute the following commands. They clones the repository, fetch the dependecies and start the developement server. The command `npm start` should automatically open a browser tab with the url (http://localhost:3000/), if not open it manually.

```
git clone https://github.com/StavrosSkourtis/react-color-manager.git

cd react-color-manager

npm install

npm start

```
